Aim is to create an interactive tool.

1. Users can have a choice
  a) Choose their own features for XGBoost to train on
  b) Choose an ML model to do feature engineering for them, then XGBoost is trained

2. Depending on choice, users will see updated metrics

3. Future development will allow users to choose from other options, such as tools to deal with feature imbalances.
