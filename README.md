🏆 Motor Fraud Detection System

🚀 Overview
This project is a machine-learning-based fraud detection system designed to analyze insurance claim data and predict fraudulent claims. The system trains on synthetic insurance data stored in MongoDB Atlas, evaluates fraud detection performance, and presents results via a Flask-powered web dashboard deployed on Render.

🔹 Key Components
- data_generator.py → Generates realistic synthetic insurance claim data and uploads it to MongoDB Atlas.
- model.py → Trains a Random Forest model on claim data, evaluating fraud detection accuracy.
- app.py → Runs the Flask web application, displaying live fraud detection results and performance metrics.
- results.html → The web interface showing model evaluation results, summary statistics, and a dataset download option.
- motor_insurance_claims.csv → A local backup of synthetic claim data used for training.
- .env → Stores secure environment variables (MongoDB connection).
- requirements.txt → Lists necessary Python dependencies for easy deployment.

🔥 Features
✅ Dynamic fraud detection model evaluation
✅ Live performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Support)
✅ Dataset summary statistics for deeper data insights
✅ Downloadable CSV dataset for offline analysis
✅ Deployable via Render for easy web access

🎯 Usage
1️⃣ Run data_generator.py to generate synthetic claim data and store it in MongoDB.
2️⃣ Run model.py to train the fraud detection model.
3️⃣ Start app.py (python app.py) and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to explore results.
4️⃣ Deploy to Render for public access.
